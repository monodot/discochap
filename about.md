It's all about that rush. The feeling as the disco music goes through your body. You can't help but dance. It doesn't matter if you're a great dancer or not.

This website is a labour of love, a passion project, an ode to my love of disco music. 

I want to share my enjoyment of this amazing and influential music genre, and I hope you enjoy browsing, just as much as I've enjoyed making this site.
