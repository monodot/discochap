It's about that rush. The feeling as the music goes through your body. You can't help but dance. It doesn't matter if you're a great dancer or not.

This website is a labour of love, a passion project, an ode to my love of disco music. I want to share my enjoyment of this amazing genre and I hope you enjoy browsing just as much as I enjoy making this site.
