## Welcome to Disco Chap

Welcome to Disco Chap! This is a website all about disco, dance music, the art of DJing, and vinyl culture.

Hi, I'm Tom Donohue, website founder and editor. I've been a bedroom and club DJ on-and-off for over 20 years, and I love dance music _with an absolute passion_. I've travelled for festivals across Europe, I've run club nights, and back in the day I DJ'd to packed clubs, warming up for some... _dubious_ acts (_ahem_, the Vengaboys)

My main goal with _Disco Chap_ is to share my love of music and DJ culture with you. Whether you're a veteran DJ, or a newbie looking to get started, I hope you find some inspiration right here.

## The Disco Chap's current DJing setup

My current DJing set up looks like this:

- **Turntables:** 2 x Technics SL-1200 turntables. I blew my first student loan on these DJ decks, and they've been faithful ever since. I love the silver finish and they are simply rock-solid. Outstanding!

- **Mixer:** [MasterSounds Radius 2][radius2]. This is a gorgeous rotary mixer which I picked up during the lockdowns of 2020. It's incredibly smooth and gives a beautiful sound. I really enjoy playing it.

- **Vinyl controller:** [Traktor Audio 6][audio6] with Traktor DJ software on Mac. I like to play a mix of vinyl and digital, and my preference is to use a digital vinyl system (DVS). With this controller, I can flip between playing analogue vinyl and digital downloads, playing both using my Technics turnables. Dreamy! The response in Traktor is great for me and I'm really happy with this setup.

- **Software:** I also currently use [Loopback from Rogue Amoeba for macOS][loopback] which allows me to route audio to different apps (e.g. streaming for Twitch)

## Where does the name 'Disco Chap' come from?

A few years ago, I was getting ready to play a DJ set at my friends' wedding in Suffolk, England, when one of their older relatives came up to me and started a conversation. 

The old man and I had never met before. We made some polite conversation, but we quickly got to the classic wedding icebreaker: "So how do you know the bride and groom?" he asked. When I replied that I knew both of them from university, and that I was just getting ready to play the _wedding disco_, the kind man said this:

> Oh, so **you're** the disco chap!

Yes, I was the disco chap. And that name stuck, really. 

A few months later, my friend Sam and I were brainstorming a few names for a new website. And _Disco Chap_ just seemed like the obvious choice. (And fortunately, _discochap.com_ was available!)

So here I am, Tom, aka Disco Chap, at your service.

I hope you enjoy browsing, just as much as I enjoy making this site for you.
