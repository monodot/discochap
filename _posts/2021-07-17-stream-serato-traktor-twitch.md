excerpt: Use this guide to stream a vinyl/digital DJ set to your friends using your DVS system, and Twitch.

Streaming tunes on Twitch is ridiculously fun. Must be why so many people are doing it. But if you're new to streaming, and especially Twitch, the technical stuff might seem difficult, and the Twitch culture baffling. So in this guide we'll see how to stream a DJ set from Traktor to Twitch, and demystify some Twitch jargon. We'll even set up a webcam so you can broadcast your _'mixing very hard'_ face to the internet.

I've been a hobbyist DJ for a few years now. In 2020, with a lot of time on my hands, I took the plunge and upgraded my old twin Technics 1200 DJ setup to a DVS (digital vinyl system) with Traktor. Pretty soon, I realised that I wanted to play sets for my friends remotely, and so I searched around to find out how to do it.

My first plan was to try to stream a DJ set for a lockdown cocktail party with friends (for the benefit of future readers - yes, remote cocktail parties were _a thing_ in 2020). But how should you do it? 

### Twitch is where everyone streams these days

**Twitch** is a video streaming site. A lot of DJs have started streaming on Twitch because it's set up like a social network and makes it very easy to connect with your followers. 

It's also, as I write this, _somewhat reluctant_ in enforcing copyright measures, at least for live broadcasts. This means that a lot of DJs are using it to play live to audiences, without the copyright strikes and getting kicked off, which you might get if you stream copyrighted music on YouTube.

**OBLIGATORY WARNING:** I am not a lawyer. You may be committing some crime in your country by streaming copyrighted music on Twitch, even if you legally own a copy. And if they chop your hands off, you won't be able to DJ anymore.

#### The reality

However, it is debatable as to whether you are likely to get penalised. What's the worst that could happen? Your Twitch account gets suspended or banned?

In the grand scheme of things, I guess it would be unlikely that you will be taken to court for streaming songs to 10 viewers (or however many friends you have.) But, people have received cease-and-desist letters for sharing movies online, so maybe there is still some risk. For now it seems there's an uneasy truce between copyright holders and Twitch.

#### Is there a legal alternative for DJs?

There is a legal alternative, if you want to do things by-the-book. But you'll forfeit the huge audience numbers and discoverability of Twitch.

[Mixcloud Pro][mixcloud] is a separate, legal streaming service for DJs. It costs Â£9 per month and sorts out all of the copyright issues for you. This means that artists and songwriters get paid for your streams.

However, with fewer website visitors than Twitch, you're less likely to build an army of fans. And if you're only streaming a one-off set to a few close friends, you might not want to fork out for a monthly subscription.

## Steps for streaming from Serato or Traktor on Twitch

Here's a setup that works for me. It's fairly basic, and doesn't require too much extra outlay on top of your existing gear. Perfect if you're already a vinyl or mixed/digital DJ and you want to stream a set for an online party or event.

So whether you're using a Serato DVS, or you've got Traktor, you should be able to make use of these tips on how to stream a vinyl/digital DJ set online.

### Get your equipment ready

You'll need:

- A Serato controller or Traktor DVS controller, and your control records

- A computer (Mac or Windows)

- A reliable internet connection (if you can get 4G signal to your cabin in the woods, awesome.)


### Register a Twitch account and get your Stream Key

#### Sign up to Twitch

You'll need an account to stream on Twitch. When you register, you'll create a _channel_. All of your streams will be broadcast on your channel. (It's similar to a channel on YouTube.)

So sign up:

[Sign up to Twitch][twitchsignup]

You need to pick a username when you sign up. This will also be used as the name of your Twitch channel. You can change it later if you need to.

#### Get your stream key

You need a stream key to connect from your streaming software to Twitch. A stream key looks like a random long string of characters. You put your stream key into the streaming software on your computer, so that Twitch knows it's _you_ who's streaming.

Your Stream Key is private to you. Treat it like a password and don't share it with anyone, because if someone has your Stream Key, they can stream on your Twitch account. This might not sound bad in the early days, but if you become successful, you don't want a hacker coming on and streaming Shania Twain to your 100,000 followers.

Keep your stream key safe, we'll need it in the next step.

### Install streaming software

You need to install some software onto your computer, which will encode your stream and send it to Twitch.

The software most people use (myself included) is **OBS Studio**. It's free and has lots of features. 

[Download OBS Studio &rarr;][obsstudio]

It basically works like a TV broadcast studio. You add audio feeds and video widgets onto your stream. Then you add your Twitch details, click _Start Broadcast_ and you're away streaming, until you stop.

If you're using Windows, you can download Streamlabs instead. Streamlabs is a rebranded version of OBS Studio, which has some extra features:

OBS Studio is a bit quirky, but we'll see how to set up your first "scene".

### Audio routing software lets you route your audio to the stream

Next, you'll need to install some software which will let you route the audio coming out of Traktor, into OBS Studio and then out to Twitch.

For reasons that are beyond my _ken_, OBS Studio can't do this itself. You need a separate bit of software to do this. You basically need a telephone switchboard for your audio.

For this, I recommend buying Loopback for Mac from Rogue Amoeba software. It's a sleek and simple Mac app that does the job well.

[Get Loopback &rarr;][loopback]

**Side note:** I've tried other "free" options and couldn't get them to work. Loopback simply works. So if you want the minimum amount of hassle, buy Loopback.

### Set up a scene

Scenes in OBS Studio are the way that you cut between different sound and video on your stream. Each scene is like a virtual TV studio "set", and OBS Studio is your gallery that switches between them.

The simplest setup is to run your entire Twitch stream from just one scene. 

So go into OBS Studio, create a scene (oi oi!), and make sure you add:

- Your audio feed from Loopback

- Some visual - either your webcam, or some other visual you'd like to stream

## Running your stream

### Going live

Once you're ready to go, hit the Start Broadcasting button in OBS Studio. In a few seconds, you'll be live on Twitch.

Share your Twitch channel URL with your friends so that they can watch.

People can watch from the Twitch website without needing an account. But if they want to talk in the chat, or follow you, they'll need to register.

### Ask your friends to _follow_ you on Twitch

Ask your friends to follow you on Twitch. Your friends will then get notified the next time you stream (so you don't need to remind them every time!)

### While you're live

- Your viewers will see your stream with a delay, sometimes up to half a minute or so.

- To interact with people in the chat, I prefer to use the Twitch app on my phone. That way, I'm not messing around trying to type on my laptop.

### When you're ending

Don't forget to play an amazing final tune (like [this one][diana]).

#### Continuing the party on another channel

Before you end the stream, you can invite your viewers to **raid** another channel. A raid is when all of your viewers get flipped over to another channel of your choice. 

You might want to do this if you've got another friend who you want to take over the party after you. This is also a good way to support other DJ streamers on Twitch!

## Upgrading your setup

Once you've got the basics nailed, there are _plenty_ of devices you can spend your hard-earned cash on, if you want to upgrade your setup, from hardware streaming boxes, to microphones, or custom in-stream graphics (you _are_ running a TV channel, after all!). We'll cover them in a future article.
  
Good luck streamin'!
