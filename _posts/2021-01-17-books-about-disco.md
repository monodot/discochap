More and more of my knowledge these days comes from reading books. When you really want to go deep into a topic, books are an awesome way to do that -- and disco is no exception.

I think my first introduction to disco was probably as a kid in the 1980s, listening to local radio and hearing songs like Abba's take on disco, _Gimme Gimme Gimme_.

When I heard Donna Summer and Patrick Cowley's classic _I Feel Love_ for the first time in a club, I wanted to find out more about this amazing music.

The first disco book I bought was _The Disco Files_ by Vince Aletti, which I pored over, discovering new records I'd never heard of. Learning more about the scene helped me enjoy the music I already know even more.

My point is, books are a great way to enhance your love of music. So stick on your favourite album, open a book and get reading.

Here are my favourite books on disco.

## Turn the Beat Around: The Secret History of Disco, by Peter Shapiro

Great book.


## Love Saves The Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture 1970-1979, by Tim Lawrence

Another great book.
